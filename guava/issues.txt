ISSUE 9:
One array is longer than another array.

Possibly could be solved by combination of: 
  https://github.com/panacekcz/checker-framework/issues/11
  https://github.com/kelloggm/checker-framework/issues/158
Example code:
   private void ensureRoomFor(@NonNegative int numberToAdd) {
      int newCount = count + numberToAdd; // TODO(kevinb): check overflow now?
      if (newCount > array.length) {
        int[] newArray = new int[expandedCapacity(array.length, newCount)];
        System.arraycopy(array, 0, newArray, 0, count);
        this.array = newArray;
      }
    }
